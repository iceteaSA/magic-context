export const CTX_SEARCH_DESCRIPTION = `Your long-term recall for this project — search local history plus explicitly requested external long-term knowledge, not just what's currently visible.

Retrieval matches meaning as well as exact words and fuses them, so phrasing matters: phrase \`query\` as a natural-language question that still contains the exact terms you expect in the answer (paths, symbols, config keys, error strings); a bare keyword stack finds less than a question carrying the same words.
- Good: "where is the retry backoff for the upload client configured?"
- Bad: "upload client retry backoff config"

Reach for it when something feels familiar but isn't in view: "did we solve this before?", "what did we decide about X?", "when did this break?", "where does Y live?". Results only contain things you CANNOT currently see — memories already shown in <project-memory> and the live conversation tail are filtered out. A query that is just one or more memory ids (e.g. \`#7234\` or \`12, 34\`) bypasses text search and resolves those ids directly.

Sources (omit for a broad search across all):
- memory: curated cross-session project knowledge — rules, constraints, conventions.
- message: the raw conversation behind your compacted history. Hits include message ordinals — expand the surrounding exchange with ctx_expand(start=N-10, end=N+5).
- git_commit: this repository's commit history.
- note: parked decisions and follow-ups with their recorded text.
- external: long-term knowledge from past sessions across projects (requires memory.external.search=true; explicit ctx_search calls only).

Picking sources:
- "when did this change / was this working before" → ["git_commit", "message"]
- "did we discuss this earlier" → ["message"]
- "did we decide something about this / leave a follow-up" → ["note"]
- "what's our convention / rule for X" → ["memory"]
- "is there anything relevant from prior sessions / other projects" → ["external"]`;
