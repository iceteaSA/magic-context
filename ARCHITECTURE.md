# Architecture

> All `src/` paths are relative to `packages/plugin/` (the published npm package). File **locations** live in `STRUCTURE.md`; this document explains how the pieces fit and — above all — the invariants that keep the Anthropic prompt cache stable. When in doubt about transform behavior, read "Transform pass mechanics" below before touching code.

## Overview

Magic Context is an `@opencode-ai/plugin` (entry `src/index.ts`) that rewrites the message array and system prompt on every LLM call to keep a long session inside the context window without losing history. Core tenets:

- **Thin adapters, real logic separated.** OpenCode-facing handlers live in `src/plugin/`; feature logic in `src/hooks/magic-context/` (runtime), `src/features/magic-context/` (services), `src/tools/` (agent tools).
- **Durable SQLite state**, never ephemeral — if storage is unavailable the plugin fails closed rather than silently letting the prompt grow past the provider limit. DB at `~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/context.db`, shared cross-harness (OpenCode + Pi); session-scoped tables carry a `harness` discriminator, project-scoped tables (memories, git commits) are shared.
- **Replay-everything for cache stability.** Every persistent message mutation (reasoning clearing, structural-noise / placeholder / image / merged-assistant stripping, caveman compression, synthetic-todowrite, drop placeholders) is re-applied deterministically on EVERY transform pass — including defer passes — so the wire bytes stay byte-identical and the provider prompt cache survives.
- **Hidden subagents** (`historian`, `historian-editor`, `dreamer`, `sidekick`) do the heavy LLM work out of band; the transform itself does no LLM calls.
- **Runtime SQLite backend** (`src/shared/sqlite.ts`): `bun:sqlite` under Bun, `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) under Node (Pi) and Electron (Desktop). The non-Bun branch adds a savepoint-aware `transaction()` shim and `readonly`→`readOnly` mapping; otherwise identical. No native module, no prebuild.
- **Pi parity:** `packages/pi-plugin/` mirrors OpenCode semantics, importing shared core from `@magic-context/core`. Intentional divergences are tracked in `packages/pi-plugin/PARITY.md`.

## Layers

- **Bootstrap** (`src/index.ts`): load config, register hidden agents + hooks + tools, start RPC server, dream-timer, auto-update checker; detect conflicting plugins (DCP / OMO / OpenCode auto-compaction) and disable the runtime if any is active.
- **Adapters** (`src/plugin/`): hook wrappers, tool registry, RPC handlers, dream-timer lifecycle, per-session hook construction.
- **Runtime** (`src/hooks/magic-context/`): the transform pipeline, postprocess phase, event/command handlers, system-prompt injection, compartment runners, decay rendering, strip-and-replay, nudges, m[0]/m[1] injection.
- **Feature services** (`src/features/magic-context/`): storage, scheduler, tagger, memory, dreamer, sidekick, key-files, git-commit + message FTS indexes, unified search, overflow detection, migrations.
- **Tools** (`src/tools/`): `ctx_reduce`, `ctx_expand`, `ctx_note`, `ctx_memory`, `ctx_search`.
- **Config + shared** (`src/config/`, `src/shared/`): Zod config (deep-merge raw JSONC before validation; invalid leaves fall back to defaults with warnings, never disable the plugin), logger, data paths, SQLite selector, harness id, RPC transport, conflict detector, tag-transcript primitive (shared with Pi).
- **TUI** (`src/tui/`): sidebar + `/ctx-status` / `/ctx-recomp` dialogs, RPC-backed; shipped as raw TS via the `./tui` export (not bundled into `dist/index.js`).
- **CLI** (`packages/cli/`, separate `@cortexkit/magic-context` package): `npx` setup / doctor / migrate wizard.

## Transform pass mechanics

This is the heart of the system and the part most easily gotten wrong. A "transform pass" is one invocation of `experimental.chat.messages.transform` (`src/hooks/magic-context/transform.ts`), wrapped defensively in `src/plugin/messages-transform.ts` (transient `SQLITE_BUSY` → return messages unmodified so the prompt loop always proceeds). OpenCode fires it once per LLM round-trip (per step within a turn).

### Pass lifecycle (in order)
1. Resolve usage + scheduler decision (`execute` vs `defer`).
2. Emergency overflow recovery if ≥95%.
3. Compartment trigger check (off the in-memory `args.messages` tail — no `opencode.db` read steady-state); fire the historian async if eligible.
4. Prepare compartment injection (decide m[0]/m[1] materialization).
5. Tag messages; replay dropped-status, caveman, reasoning, placeholder, image strips.
6. Compartment phase: inject the `<session-history>` (m[0]/m[1]) into `message[0]`.
7. **Postprocess** (`transform-postprocess-phase.ts`): the mutation gates — pending-op drain, heuristic cleanup, nudges, synthetic-todowrite, auto-search.

**Tool surface:**
- Purpose: Expose agent tools with validated schemas and storage-backed execution.
- Location: `src/tools/ctx-reduce/`, `src/tools/ctx-expand/`, `src/tools/ctx-note/`, `src/tools/ctx-memory/`, `src/tools/ctx-search/`, `src/tools/ctx-skill-note/`, `src/tools/ctx-skill-recall/`
- Contains: Tool definitions, argument schemas, action gating (incl. dreamer-only actions in `ctx_memory`), user-facing result formatting. The two `ctx_skill_*` tools share a `recallSkillMemoryBlock` core with the transparent after-hook path (see Skill-memory in Key Abstractions) so write-back and explicit recall both go through the same recall+format pipeline.
- Depends on: `src/features/magic-context/`, `src/features/magic-context/skill-memory/`, and `src/hooks/magic-context/read-session-chunk.ts`.
- Used by: `src/plugin/tool-registry.ts`.

### Pass taxonomy (every pass is exactly one)
- **SOFT+ (defer / `cache_hit`):** nothing new. m[0] AND m[1] replay byte-identical; the entire `system + m[0] + m[1]` prefix stays cached. Only the conversation tail moves (where `ctx_reduce`/age drops land, themselves replayed deterministically). The steady state — most passes are this.
- **SOFT (cache-busting):** m[1] re-renders (new compartments / memories / user-profile surface as deltas) while m[0] stays byte-identical. `system + m[0]` stays cached; the cache busts at the m[1] breakpoint. Driven by an execute pass, `/ctx-flush`, or a deferred-history drain.
- **HARD (m[0] fold):** `mustMaterialize` fires → m[0] re-materializes, folding m[1] into the new decayed baseline and resetting m[1] to a placeholder. The whole prefix rebuilds — but "for free" because the provider cache key was already dead (see HARD triggers in "m[0]/m[1] cache layout"). **Decay re-tiering happens ONLY on a HARD fold** — a SOFT pass must never re-tier (that would change m[0] bytes).

### The mutation gates (the part to get right)
Pending-op drain and heuristic cleanup are each gated by the same shape in `transform-postprocess-phase.ts`:
```
shouldApplyPendingOps / shouldRunHeuristics =
  (execute || materializationRequested || forceMaterialization || m0HardFoldThisPass)  // BUST clause: is this pass busting anyway?
  && (!compartmentRunning || emergencyBypassCompartmentGate)                            // VETO clause: is the historian mid-run?
```
- **BUST clause** — only mutate (drop tools, run heuristics) on a pass that is *already* busting the prefix, so the mutation rides that one bust instead of causing its own. `m0HardFoldThisPass` is the fold-exec signal (an advisory `mustMaterialize` call earlier in postprocess).
- **VETO clause — `compartmentRunning`** — block mutation while the historian is summarizing the tail, so we don't change the bytes it's reading mid-run. Bypassed by `emergencyBypassCompartmentGate`.
- **`emergencyBypassCompartmentGate`** bypasses the veto when `forceMaterialization` (≥85%) **OR `m0HardFoldThisPass`** — i.e. a hard fold drains pending ops + runs heuristics even while the historian runs, because the prefix is busting regardless (see "drain into the known bust" invariant). This is safe per the disjoint-DB model below; Pi already does this (`context-handler.ts`).

### Load-bearing invariants (memorize these)
1. **A HARD bust means the prefix is already gone → drain EVERYTHING into it. Never "defer" a hard bust.** This pass IS the fold; there is no later fold to wait for. Deferring the drain only produces a second, avoidable bust ~one turn later. (The `compartmentRunning` veto must therefore yield to a hard fold — the fold-exec bypass.)
2. **A defer (SOFT+) pass must replay byte-identical.** Any first-application of a strip/drop on a defer pass changes tail bytes and busts the whole prefix after it. Watermark-gated strips (placeholders, images, stale-`ctx_reduce`) use a **frozen-id replay** pattern: detect-and-freeze the affected ids only on cache-busting passes, replay the frozen set on every pass. There is exactly ONE drop placeholder string, `[dropped §N§]`, a pure function of tag id — never re-derive bytes from mutated content (that caused repeated cache catastrophes).
3. **Deferred work rides the next bust cycle; it never forces its own.** Historian publishes, compaction-marker moves, and queued drops accumulate while m[1] replays frozen, and materialize together on the next genuine bust (execute / hard fold / flush). A historian publish does NOT bust the cache — between busts every pass is `cache_hit`.
4. **Boundary execution defers mid-turn.** `execute` decisions become `defer` while the latest assistant turn is mid-tool-use (CAS-flag `deferred_execute_state`), so we don't rewrite bytes while a turn is still accumulating tool calls. Bypasses: ≥85% force, explicit-bust, subagent. Drained re-peek-and-clear at end of postprocess.

### Disjoint-DB safety model
Mutating while the historian runs is safe because the two databases are disjoint on the read/write side:
- The historian reads **raw** OpenCode messages from **`opencode.db`** (read-only) for its chunk.
- Drops + heuristics mutate **`context.db`** (`tags` / `pending_ops`) and the in-memory outgoing wire only.
- The historian's in-flight snapshot is validated by `computeRawRangeFingerprint`, which hashes **raw content only** (ids, part types, content lengths) — never tag/drop state — so a concurrent drop can't invalidate it.
- Its post-publish `queueDropsForCompartmentalizedMessages` is idempotent against already-dropped tags.

## m[0]/m[1] cache layout

The compacted history renders into TWO synthetic `user`-role message slots at the head, so the large stable prefix survives steady-state work. `inject-compartments.ts` (`renderM0` / `renderM1` / `materializeM0` / `mustMaterialize`), mirrored in `inject-compartments-pi.ts`. Both slots prepend with `synthetic: true` parts so they don't count toward OpenCode's title-generation gate.

- **m[0] — cumulative baseline (frozen, like `system[0]`).** Holds `<project-docs>` (root `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `STRUCTURE.md`), baseline `<user-profile>`, and the decay-rendered compartment history as of the last materialization. Does NOT change on routine turns.
- **m[1] — volatile delta.** Holds everything added since the last m[0] materialization: `<key-files>`, new user-profile additions, new memories (via the `maxMemoryId` watermark), `<memory-updates>` supersede deltas, and the newest compartments at full tier. Renders a minimal placeholder when empty (never fully empty — Anthropic cache-breakpoint structure).

**`mustMaterialize` (HARD fold) triggers — organized around the bust taxonomy** so the trigger list and the m[0]/m[1] contract can never silently disagree:
- *Provider-side cache eviction* (the cache is already dead, so folding is free): model/provider change (`cachedM0ModelKey`), system-prompt-hash change (`cachedM0SystemHash`), idle > TTL (`cacheExpired`, self-consuming via `lastResponseTime > cachedM0MaterializedAt`).
- *Genuine m[0] content change* (baseline bytes differ): first render, `cached_m1_missing`, `project_memory_epoch` change (dashboard / external mutation), pending m[0] mutations (`max_mutation_id` — structural compartment delete/merge/recomp), upgrade-state change.
- **Deliberately NOT triggers** (these are m[1] deltas — triggering would bust m[0] on routine background work and defeat the design): **new compartment sequence**, `project_user_profile_version`, `maxMemoryId`, **project-docs-hash change** (docs edits fold in on the next natural hard bust, never on their own), and **tool-set-hash change** (process-global, false positives).
- **Pressure backstop refold:** on a cache-busting pass, if no natural HARD bust has arrived but m[1] has grown large — gated by the m[1]/m[0] size ratio (with a small-m[0] floor) OR an absolute m[1] token cap (~20% of history budget) OR a large memory-mutation count.
- `applyMarkersToState` updates ALL `state.cachedM0*` fields post-materialize (guards against an infinite re-materialize loop). `/ctx-flush` is SOFT (drives m[1] refresh + heuristics, not an m[0] fold).

**Memory mutations route through m[1], not the epoch.** In-session `ctx_memory` mutations do NOT bump `project_memory_epoch`: additive writes surface via the `maxMemoryId` watermark; non-additive (`update`/`archive`/`merge`) record a `memory_mutation_log` row rendered as a `<memory-updates>` delta. Both reconcile into m[0] on the next natural hard bust. The epoch is bumped only by **dashboard** mutations and `/ctx-session-upgrade` migration (an external editor can't otherwise signal a running session).

## Historian compartment flow (produce → store → render)

The long-history pipeline. Tiered compartments + deterministic decay renderer (replaced the v1 flat-compartment + LLM-compressor model).

1. **Trigger** (`compartment-trigger.ts`): threshold-relative pressure (`context_limit × execute_threshold × 5%`, clamped 5k–50k), commit clusters, and TC-chunked unsummarized-tail size (`≥ triggerBudget × 3`), while protecting the live tail. Runs off the in-memory tail (zero `opencode.db` reads steady-state); hands the resolved boundary snapshot to the runner so the historian sees exactly what the fire decision saw.
2. **Produce** (`compartment-runner-incremental.ts`): runs the historian subagent on the raw chunk above the last compartment boundary with a **bounded** prompt (no full state dump) — 4 rotating seed compartments + the last 6 persisted compartments + the project-memory block for fact dedup. Emits each compartment with 4 paraphrase tiers (`p1` verbose → `p4` anchor-only), an `importance` (decay-rate semantics), an `episode_type`, a `<facts>` block in the 5-category taxonomy, and an `<events>` block.
3. **Parse + validate**: `parseCompartmentOutput` + `validateHistorianOutput` (contiguous, non-overlapping ranges, correct `unprocessed_from`).
4. **Discard-last boundary healing**: if the historian consumed to the chunk edge with weak lookahead, the last (lookahead-free) compartment is not persisted; the next run re-reads it at the head with full lookahead. Guarded by progress (`k≥2`) and emergency-disabled.
5. **Store**: publish transaction appends compartments with tier columns. Promotable facts promote to project memory (exact-dedup); `user_observations` stored only when `dreamer.user_memories.enabled` (privacy gate). Events → `compartment_events`. Compartment-chunk embeddings generated on publish (memory-gated). Publish defers a compaction-marker move (see Subsystems) and signals a deferred history refresh — it does NOT force a bust.
6. **Render (decay)**: `decay-render.ts` (shared OpenCode + Pi) picks one tier per compartment via `decay-curve.ts`: half-life `H = H50·2^((I−50)/D)/max(p,0.10)` (`H50=24`, `D=25`), log-cost tier boundaries `[0.201,0.729,1.322,2.587]`, budget pressure `p` once per pass. Older / lower-importance / higher-pressure compartments demote oldest-first; past the archive boundary they render P4/self-close or drop. Self-tunes as the context window changes — no LLM call. Legacy (pre-v2) rows render P3 (if they carry a `U:` line) else P4.
7. **Recomp / upgrade**: `/ctx-recomp` rebuilds compartment structure from raw history (emits NO facts — preserves curated memories). `/ctx-session-upgrade` runs full recomp + a once-per-project 9→5-category memory migration (`active` only, `permanent` untouched, bumps the epoch).

## Protected-tail boundary

`protected-tail-boundary.ts` decides, per pass, which prefix of the raw tail is eligible for the historian and which suffix stays protected — from true-raw token sizes (not user-turn counts), so sparse-user-turn sessions can't deadlock the historian (#132). Boundary anchors at `lastCompartmentEnd + 1`; token target `N` capped at `0.40 × usable` (ABS_CAP 96k); a live-prompt floor keeps it from crossing the newest meaningful user message on routine (<80%) passes. **Open tool arcs** (a tool invocation with no result in the window) only hold the boundary back when **recent** (≥ the size-walk start = the live window); a stale/interrupted open arc older than that is compactable — otherwise one dead `running` tool call at the eligible-head edge would freeze the historian indefinitely. The trigger/runner share a content-stable range fingerprint for cross-view staleness validation.

**Skill-memory flow (per-skill cross-session recall):** transparent augmentation of opencode's built-in `skill` tool — when a loaded skill declares `skill-memory: { enabled: true }` in its frontmatter, accumulated gotchas/discoveries surface in a `<skill-memory>` block appended to the skill tool's RESULT on every load. Three opencode hooks plus two agent-callable tools implement the loop.
1. **Definition (`tool.definition` in `src/hooks/magic-context/skill-tool-definition.ts`)** — augments the `skill` tool's JSON Schema with an optional `intent` string parameter. Effect-Schema strips unknown keys (`onExcessProperty: "ignore"`) before the skill tool runs, so `intent` never reaches the skill itself; the before-hook captures it pre-validation. Idempotent (re-adds are guarded).
2. **Before (`tool.execute.before` in `src/hooks/magic-context/hook-handlers.ts` — `createToolExecuteBeforeHook`)** — stashes the raw `intent` by `callID` in a bounded closure-state `Map<string, {intent, ts}>` (60s TTL sweep + 256-entry cap + full clear on session delete, so unpaired before-hooks never leak). The stash is the only place `intent` is observable; it's deleted in the after-hook's `finally`.
3. **After (`tool.execute.after` in `src/hooks/magic-context/hook-handlers.ts` — `createToolExecuteAfterHook`)** — runs only for `input.tool === "skill"`. Parses the `Base directory for this skill: file:///...` line from `output.output` via `parseSkillProvenance()` (`fileURLToPath`-based, cross-platform) to recover the resolved `SKILL.md` path + tier (project/global) + `skill_source`. Then re-reads `SKILL.md` from disk (opencode's skill loader strips the `skill-memory:` block from the model-facing output, so the frontmatter is unreadable from `output.output`). Populates a session-scoped `SkillLoadRegistry` keyed by `${sessionId}:${skillId}` (NOT persisted, cleaned in `onSessionDeleted`). When frontmatter has `enabled: true` and notes exist, delegates to `recallSkillMemoryBlock` (feature layer) and appends the block to `output.output` BEFORE the Channel-1 ctx_reduce nudge runs.
4. **Cache safety (keystone).** The append lands in the skill tool RESULT = conversation tail, NOT the cached m[0]/m[1] prefix. This is why the feature cannot regress the prompt-cache hit rate. Channel-1 already appends to tool output strings the same way (precedent in `maybeInjectChannel1Nudge`) — this is proven production behavior.
5. **Write-back (`ctx_skill_note`)** — `kind` is a hard gate rejecting `'general'` at the tool level; duplicates dedup on `normalized_hash` and bump `hit_count` (`computeNormalizedHash` from `memory/normalize-hash.ts`). Resolves `(skill_id, tier, project_identity, resolved_path)` from the session-scoped `SkillLoadRegistry` (so the agent must load the skill first — actionable error otherwise). Inserts into the `skill_memory` table (migration v39). The injected block footer reinforces: "After using this skill, call `ctx_skill_note` — record only gotchas, novel discoveries, or error→fix; skip routine successes."
6. **Explicit recall (`ctx_skill_recall`)** — companion tool to the transparent path; reuses `recallSkillMemoryBlock` so P2 embeddings upgrade both at once. Registry-first resolution (exact, free, no disk I/O when the skill was loaded this session) with a cold-start disk fallback that walks opencode's real `discoverSkills()` order (project dirs first — they shadow global — then global external + config dirs).
7. **Dreamer distill (`distill-skill-memory` task — opt-in, NOT a default)** — `DREAMER_TASKS` enum carries it (line 25 of `src/config/schema/magic-context.ts`); `DEFAULT_DREAMER_TASKS` does NOT (mirroring the `maintain-docs` precedent). The task prompt lives in `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/task-prompts.ts` and runs the merge/prune/promote maintenance cycle documented in CONFIGURATION.md.

**Git-commit indexing:**
- `src/features/magic-context/git-commits/indexer.ts` reads HEAD-only non-merge commits via `git log` (NUL-byte-free format separator `\x1f`), bounded by `experimental.git_commit_indexing.{since_days, max_commits}`.
- Embeddings are generated through the same embedding provider chain as memories.
- Indexing fires from the dream-timer startup tick and periodic interval; manual `/ctx-dream` does NOT trigger commit indexing.

## Memory, search & embeddings

- **Memories** (`memory/storage-memory.ts`): project-scoped durable knowledge in the 5-category taxonomy (PROJECT_RULES / ARCHITECTURE / CONSTRAINTS / CONFIG_VALUES / NAMING), with FTS + vector side tables. `ctx_memory` exposes write/archive/update/merge/list; `list` is dreamer-only; primary agents may only mutate their own project's memories (workspace-shared categories aside).
- **Unified search** (`search.ts`): one query embedding dispatched across memories, raw message history (FTS via `message-index.ts`), indexed git commits, and compartment-chunk embeddings. Hard-filters memories already visible in `<session-history>` and raw-message hits newer than the last compartment boundary (already in context).
- **Embeddings**: vectors stored as plain SQLite BLOBs, scanned in-memory via `Float32Array` cosine (sqlite-vec rejected — `bun:sqlite` can't load extensions + write-amplification). Provider resolved per-project; a substitution guard rejects a served model that doesn't match the requested one. Compartment-chunk embedding is on-demand via `/ctx-embed` (auto-drains the active session once per process; resilient retry with circuit-break; chunk-window config folds into chunk identity so it doesn't invalidate memory/commit vectors).
- **Workspaces** (`workspaces` / `workspace_members`): a project belongs to at most one workspace; member sessions read the union of members' memories (repo-attributed), gated per-category by `share_categories`. A `cached_m0_workspace_fingerprint` (sorted identity+epoch+categories hash) detects membership/policy changes for a single hard fold on change.

## Dreamer

Background maintenance, one worker at a time. Eligible projects detected on `message.updated` (12h cooldown), enqueued by a process-wide 15-min timer, serialized by a DB lease (TTL + renewal). Each task spawns one child session (`dreamer/runner.ts`); model resolved through the fallback chain. Tasks: consolidate, verify, archive-stale, improve, maintain-docs, plus optional user-memory review / smart-note evaluation / key-file identification (config-gated). A circuit breaker aborts after 3 consecutive identical failures. Queue rows are project-scoped (a host only dequeues projects it has loaded).

## Other subsystems

- **Synthetic-todowrite**: `tool.execute.after` captures todo state to `last_todo_state` (pure DB write). On a cache-busting pass, postprocess injects a synthetic `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair (call_id = `mc_synthetic_todo_<sha256(state)[:16]}`) into the latest assistant message, AFTER tagging so it's never dropped. Defer passes rebuild from the persisted `state_json` for byte-identity.
- **ctx_reduce nudges**: Channel 1 appends a `<system-reminder>` to tool outputs in `tool.execute.after` (persisted to OpenCode's DB → replays for free). Channel 2 delivers a one-shot synthetic-user ceiling nudge at step boundaries via the live-server client (`promptAsync` with `synthetic: true`). Both gate on `ctx_reduce` actually being in the session's tool allow-list. Trigger math: severity over the working window, `reclaimable ≥ usable/3`, protected tags excluded.
- **Tiered emergency drop (≥85%)**: target-headroom eviction down to `fixedFloor + 0.30 × (ceiling − fixedFloor)`, tools oldest-first across tiers (T3 misc → T2 edit/search → T1 navigation), newest-20% recency reserve on T1/T2. `floorTags` (full active set, for floor accounting) vs `tags` (droppable candidates). `last_emergency_input_sample` is the idempotence latch. The newest-20 dropped tool calls keep a `[dropped §N§]` skeleton (the `tool_use` survives, output replaced) so provider tool-pairing holds; older drops are fully removed.
- **Compaction markers**: inject an OpenCode-compatible compaction boundary so `filterCompacted` stops at the historian's last compartment, shrinking the transform-input array. The marker move is **deferred** from historian publish into the next materializing pass (one bust covers both the `<session-history>` rebuild and the boundary advance); CAS-guarded, restart-safe.
- **Content stripping** (`strip-content.ts`, `caveman.ts`, `sentinel.ts`): stateless strip functions + deterministic in-place sentinel replacement + persisted watermarks. Provider-aware: empty-content sentinels only stay empty for providers that accept them (`modelAcceptsEmptyContent`); others get a `[dropped]` placeholder (e.g. Copilot/Bedrock break tool adjacency on empty parts — #135).
- **Message / git-commit indexes**: FTS5 raw-message index maintained outside the search hot path (async reconciliation + live `message.updated` events); HEAD-only non-merge git-commit corpus populated by the dream timer.
- **System-prompt injection** (`system-prompt-hash.ts`): injects only the Magic Context guidance text + a frozen `Today's date:` line (per-session sticky, updated only on cache-busting passes). Adjunct blocks (`<project-docs>` / `<user-profile>` / `<key-files>`) are NOT here — they moved into m[0]/m[1] so the system prompt stays maximally cache-stable. Skipped entirely for OpenCode's internal `title`/`summary`/`compaction` agents and for hidden child sessions (detected by the `magic-context-` title prefix).
- **TUI ↔ server RPC**: localhost server on an ephemeral port (published to `session_meta`); the TUI plugin reads all data via RPC (no direct SQLite, avoids lock contention).

## Storage & migrations

`storage-db.ts` creates the schema and runs versioned migrations (`migrations.ts`, currently v1–v36). `LATEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION` is a schema fence — it MUST be bumped with every new migration (a unit test asserts it equals the highest migration), and a stale value makes the DB refuse to open after the migration applies. `ensureColumn()` + `healAllNullColumns()` backfill upgraded DBs even if a migration row is lost. New session-scoped tables must be added to `clearSession()`. A bulletproof `MAGIC_CONTEXT_TEST_DATA_DIR` guard keeps the test suite off the live DB (running `bun test` once migrated a live DB and fail-closed running binaries). SQLite binds must use SPREAD positional args, never the array form (`bun:sqlite` binds a lone array positionally; `node:sqlite` reads it as named params and throws).

## Session modes

Three effective modes; the heavier features (historian, nudges, adjunct injection) are gated, while tag/drop plumbing stays on everywhere.

**Decay rendering (replaces the LLM compressor):**
- Purpose: Deterministically choose a render tier per compartment from age, importance, and live history-budget pressure — self-tuning as the model's context window changes, with zero LLM cost.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/decay-curve.ts` (validated formula + tier boundaries), `src/hooks/magic-context/decay-render.ts` (shared OpenCode + Pi renderer).
- Pattern: Exponential half-life `H = H50·2^((I−50)/D)/max(p,0.10)` (`H50=24`, `D=25`); log-cost tier thresholds `[0.201,0.729,1.322,2.587]`; budget pressure computed once per pass; oldest-first demotion; archive/self-close past the last boundary. Council-validated invariants (monotonicity, finite demotion, O(budget) cost) locked by `decay-curve.test.ts`.

**Compartment events (v2, stored-not-rendered):**
- Purpose: Persist historian-extracted `causal_incident` / `trajectory_correction` events as a corpus for future dreamer aggregation; never rendered into the prompt in v2.0.
- Location: `compartment_events` table (migration v23); `insertCompartmentEvents` / `getCompartmentEvents`.
- Pattern: Anchored to durable compartment ids (`at_compartment` → id at publish); discarded-tail events filtered; cleared on session deletion.

**Message-history index:**
- Purpose: FTS-backed raw user/assistant message search outside the transform hot path.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/message-index.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/message-index-async.ts`
- Pattern: Async reconciliation + live event indexing + pure-query reads.

**Git-commit index:**
- Purpose: Per-project HEAD-only commit corpus for `ctx_search` integration.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/git-commits/`
- Pattern: NUL-free git log reader + FTS index + embedding side table; populated by dream timer.

**Dream queue and lease:**
- Purpose: Run at most one dream worker at a time and survive restarts.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/queue.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/lease.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/storage-dream-state.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/storage-dream-runs.ts`
- Pattern: SQLite-backed queue plus cooperative lease lock plus durable run-history table.

**Key-files pinning:**
- Purpose: Inject up to N project files into the system prompt as `<key-files>` content for the active session.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/key-files/identify-key-files.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/key-files/read-stats.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/key-files/storage-key-files.ts`
- Pattern: Per-session selection by Dreamer; budget-bound rendering; symlink-safe realpath check.

**User memory pipeline:**
- Purpose: Extract user behavioral observations from historian output (the v2 `<user_observations>` block), collect candidates, and promote recurring patterns to stable global user memories.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/user-memory/storage-user-memory.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/user-memory/review-user-memories.ts`
- Pattern: Historian extracts candidates **only when `dreamer.user_memories.enabled`** (privacy gate, enforced post-commit best-effort on both harnesses); dreamer reviews with a multi-session recurrence gate and promotes; the baseline set renders into m[0] `<user-profile>` (new promotions into m[1]). user_memories are globally scoped (no `project_path`).

**Skill-memory (motor memory for skills):**
- Purpose: Per-skill cross-session recall — when a skill declares `skill-memory: { enabled: true }` in its frontmatter, accumulated gotchas/discoveries/fixes/workflow steps surface in a `<skill-memory>` block appended to the skill tool's RESULT on every load. Agents write back via `ctx_skill_note`; explicit recall (without re-loading) is `ctx_skill_recall`. The transparent after-hook is the primary path; the two tools are companions.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/skill-memory/{frontmatter,provenance,storage,recall}.ts`; `src/hooks/magic-context/skill-tool-definition.ts` + the `skill-memory` branches in `src/hooks/magic-context/hook-handlers.ts`; `src/tools/ctx-skill-note/`, `src/tools/ctx-skill-recall/`. Table created in migration v38 (`skill_memory`).
- Pattern: Three-hook transparent augmentation (definition → before → after). The before-hook stashes a per-callID `intent` (bounded 60s TTL + 256-cap + session-delete clear). The after-hook parses the `Base directory for this skill: file:///...` line (cross-platform via `fileURLToPath`), reads the skill's `SKILL.md` from disk to recover its `skill-memory:` frontmatter (opencode strips it from the model-facing output), populates a session-scoped `SkillLoadRegistry` (NOT persisted), and calls `recallSkillMemoryBlock` (feature layer — shared core used by the tool too) to format the injected block. Append lands in the tool RESULT (conversation tail) — cache-safe by construction. P1 retrieval is flat: recency × hit_count, no embeddings (P2 rungs are designed and marked TODO in `recall.ts`). Per-skill opt-in via SKILL.md frontmatter (`enabled: true` required; `max_tokens` 1500 / `max_pinned_tokens` 4000 / `dedup_threshold` 0.92 are tunable). Optional dreamer `distill-skill-memory` task (opt-in, NOT a default) handles merge/prune/promote maintenance.

**TUI ↔ server RPC:**
- Purpose: Localhost RPC for sidebar data, status/recomp dialogs, and TUI-action consumption.
- Location: `src/shared/rpc-server.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-client.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-utils.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-types.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-notifications.ts`, `src/plugin/rpc-handlers.ts`
- Pattern: Server publishes ephemeral port; TUI plugin polls for state and pushes notifications via the message queue.

**Plugin message bus (legacy):**
- Purpose: Historical SQLite-backed TUI ↔ server bus, retained for migration compatibility.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/plugin-messages.ts`
- Pattern: Vestigial — superseded by RPC. Module remains for forward-compat with older TUI plugin versions that may still poll it; no active runtime callers in current code.

**Compaction markers (deferred drain, plan v6):**
- Purpose: Inject OpenCode-compatible compaction boundaries into the message table so `filterCompacted` stops at historian's last compartment boundary, shrinking the transform-input array. Marker movement is deferred from historian publish into the next materializing transform pass so a single cache-bust cycle covers both the `<session-history>` rebuild AND the marker boundary advance.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/compaction-marker.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/compaction-marker-manager.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-persisted.ts` (pending blob helpers).
- Pattern: Historian incremental runner writes the prospective new boundary (`{ordinal, endMessageId, publishedAt}`) into `session_meta.pending_compaction_marker_state` in the same transaction that publishes new compartments. The next consuming transform pass that drains `deferredHistoryRefreshSessions` calls `applyDeferredCompactionMarker(...)`, which validates the pending target against the latest stored compartment via `getCompartmentsByEndMessageId(...)` plus an OpenCode-message existence check via `getOpenCodeMessageById(...)`, then sequences `removeCompactionMarker` → `injectCompactionMarker`. Returns a tagged `MarkerUpdateOutcome` (`applied` | `already-current` | `stale-skip` | `retryable-failure`); only `retryable-failure` preserves the deferred-history signal so the next pass retries. CAS-clear (`clearPendingCompactionMarkerStateIf`) on success guards against publish/drain races within and across processes. Eager paths (`/ctx-flush`, `/ctx-recomp`) call the marker manager directly and CAS-clear any stale pending blob. Restart-safe: hook init calls `getSessionsWithPendingMarker(...)` to rehydrate deferred sets so the next pass after restart still drains. `event-handler` CAS-clears pending state on `session.compacted` (provider already advanced the boundary) and on `session.deleted` via cascade. Raw-history readers strip `summary=true` / `finish="stop"` rows to preserve original ordinals. Stable feature, default `compaction_markers: true` since v0.16.x; deferred drain since v0.19 (plan v6).

**Auto-update checker:**
- Purpose: Self-update the cached `@latest` plugin install once per plugin process — OpenCode's plugin cache no longer auto-updates.
- Location: `src/hooks/auto-update-checker/checker.ts`, `src/hooks/auto-update-checker/cache.ts`, `src/hooks/auto-update-checker/constants.ts`
- Pattern: Fires from plugin init with on-disk cross-process dedup; rewrites the install-directory dependency entry + `bun.lock` (or runs `npm install` under OpenCode's npm-managed cache).

**Agent prompt pack:**
- Purpose: Keep hidden-agent identities and prompt text isolated from runtime wiring.
- Location: `src/agents/dreamer.ts`, `src/agents/historian.ts` (declares `HISTORIAN_AGENT` and `HISTORIAN_EDITOR_AGENT`), `src/agents/sidekick.ts`, `src/agents/magic-context-prompt.ts`
- Pattern: Constants plus prompt builders.

**Content stripping and replay:**
- Purpose: Strip reasoning, inline thinking, placeholder shells, structural noise, processed images, merged-assistant reasoning, system-injected stripping, and caveman compression from messages, and replay those operations on every transform pass to maintain stable message content across OpenCode's message rebuilds.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/strip-content.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/caveman.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/caveman-cleanup.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/sentinel.ts`
- Pattern: Stateless strip functions plus deterministic in-place sentinel replacement (preserves message-part array shape across passes); paired with persisted watermarks (`cleared_reasoning_through_tag`, `stripped_placeholder_ids`, `tags.caveman_depth`) read from `session_meta` and `tags`. Several strips are provider-aware: `stripReasoningFromMergedAssistants` runs only for `anthropic`; whole-message empty-sentinel writes a `[dropped]` placeholder for non-Anthropic providers so openai-compatible providers don't see empty assistant messages.

**Protected-tail boundary (v3):**
- Purpose: Decide, per pass, which prefix of the raw tail is eligible for the historian and which suffix stays protected — from true-raw token sizes instead of user-turn counts, so sparse-user-turn sessions can't deadlock the historian (issue #132).
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/protected-tail-boundary.ts` (resolver), `src/hooks/magic-context/read-session-true-raw-tokens.ts` (ordinal-keyed token index, fed by cached per-tag token counts with live-tokenize fallback), `src/hooks/magic-context/compartment-trigger.ts` (trigger consumption).
- Pattern: Boundary offset anchors at `lastCompartmentEnd + 1`; token target `N` capped at `0.40 × usable`; pure function of (messages, usage, budget) — no persisted high-watermark (backward relaxation is the #132 fix). The trigger runs in the transform off the in-memory `args.messages` tail (zero opencode.db reads steady-state; the resolved snapshot is handed to the runner so the historian sees exactly what the fire decision saw), with content-stable range fingerprints for cross-view staleness validation.

**ctx_reduce nudges (Channel 1 / Channel 2):**
- Purpose: Keep the agent reducing its own context without cache-busting mutations — Channel 1 appends a `<system-reminder>` to tool outputs in `tool.execute.after` (persisted to OpenCode's DB, so the bytes are durable and replay for free); Channel 2 delivers a one-shot synthetic-user ceiling nudge near the execute threshold via the live-server client on step-boundary `message.updated` events (mid-turn "tool-calls" and final "stop") — the queued message lands at the next step so the agent is warned while the pile is still growing.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/ctx-reduce-nudge.ts` (shared math: severity, `reclaimable ≥ usable/3` trigger), `src/hooks/magic-context/hook-handlers.ts` (Channel 1 injection), `src/hooks/magic-context/channel2-delivery.ts` (Channel 2 lease + delivery), `packages/pi-plugin/src/ctx-reduce-nudge-pi.ts` (Pi mirror: `tool_result` mutation + `agent_end` followUp).
- Pattern: Channel-1 baselines (per-session, in-memory) carry the measurement (`tailToolTokens`, `usableTokens`) the triggers evaluate; Channel 2 uses a cross-process CAS lease (`channel2_nudge_state`: pending → claimed → delivered) with full-predicate revalidation at delivery — unknown baseline never delivers, stale predicate cancels to re-armable, only confirmed sends consume the one-per-session cap.

**Tiered emergency drop (≥85%):**
- Purpose: Replace need-blind routine tool drops with a target-headroom eviction at force-materialize pressure — reclaim down to `fixedFloor + 0.30 × (ceiling − fixedFloor)`, evicting tool outputs oldest-first across tiers (T3 misc → T2 edit/search → T1 navigation), with newest-20% recency reserves on T1/T2.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/emergency-drop.ts` (pure planner), applied from `heuristic-cleanup.ts` / `heuristic-cleanup-pi.ts`.
- Pattern: Split tag sets — `floorTags` (FULL active live-window set, floor accounting) vs `tags` (tool-only `canDrop()` eviction candidates); `last_emergency_input_sample` is the idempotence latch (no re-drop until a fresh provider usage reading arrives).

**Caveman text compression (experimental):**
- Purpose: Apply oldest-first age-tier text compression to user/assistant text outside the protected tail when `ctx_reduce_enabled=false`.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/caveman.ts`
- Pattern: Four tiers (ultra/full/lite/untouched) keyed by raw-ordinal age within the non-protected region. Persisted per-tag `caveman_depth` enables byte-identical replay; depth escalation always recomputes from `source_contents` to avoid lossy double compression.

**Synthetic todowrite injection:**
- Purpose: Inject a deterministic `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair so the agent sees current todo state through its native todowrite mental model, even when real todowrite tool calls have been dropped from the prefix.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/todo-view.ts` (renderer + hash), `src/hooks/magic-context/transform-postprocess-phase.ts` (B7 logic), `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-persisted.ts` (state persistence)
- Pattern: Capture-path is pure DB write; cache-busting-pass injects fresh and persists `(call_id, anchor_message_id, state_json)`; defer-pass replays from persisted state_json for byte-identical wire bytes.

**Persisted session meta:**
- Purpose: Store per-session scalars and JSON blobs that must survive across transform passes and OpenCode restarts.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-shared.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-persisted.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-session.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta.ts`
- Pattern: `session_meta` SQLite table with `ensureColumn()` and versioned migrations; typed row interfaces with runtime guards; NULL coercion in `isSessionMetaRow()` so legacy rows don't trigger fallback-to-defaults on every read.

**Cache-busting signals (plan v6):**
- Purpose: Surface durable per-pass facts the postprocess phase uses to decide whether the v12 deferred-history drain, the deferred-marker drain, and the deferred-materialization drain are eligible to fire — without re-reading transform state.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/cache-busting-signals.ts`, threaded into `RunPostTransformPhaseArgs` (`historyRebuiltThisPass`, `historyRefreshExplicitBeforePrepare`, `compartmentInjectionRebuiltFromDb`, `canConsumeDeferredLate`, `phaseJustAwaitedPublication`, etc.).
- Pattern: Captured at well-defined points in `transform.ts` (e.g. `historyRefreshExplicitBeforePrepare` is read immediately before `prepareCompartmentInjection`, not later) so concurrent transform passes don't clobber each other's signals. The drain decision (`historyWasConsumedThisPass`) combines `historyRebuiltThisPass && (canConsumeDeferredLate || phaseJustAwaitedPublication || explicitRebuildHappened) && materializationSatisfied`. Degraded-cache state (null-boundary rebuild) is tracked by `degradedCacheCountBySession` in postprocess; entry logs in `inject-compartments.ts` and a warning at `DEGRADE_CACHE_WARNING_THRESHOLD=10` consecutive degraded rebuilds.

## Entry Points

**CLI entry:**
- Location: `packages/cli/src/index.ts` (separate `@cortexkit/magic-context` package).
- Triggers: Executed as the unified `magic-context` bin target via `npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest <subcommand>`.
- Responsibilities: Detect installed harnesses (OpenCode, Pi) and dispatch `setup` / `doctor` / `migrate` flows; print usage on unknown commands.

**Plugin entry:**
- Location: `src/index.ts`
- Triggers: OpenCode loads the package entry declared in `package.json`.
- Responsibilities: Load config; surface config-warning toasts/ignored-messages; disable the plugin when conflicting plugins are detected (DCP, OMO context-management, OpenCode auto-compaction); register hidden agents (`historian`, `historian-editor`, `dreamer`, `sidekick`); start RPC server; start auto-update checker; start dream-schedule timer; wire hooks, commands, and tools.

**TUI plugin entry:**
- Location: `src/tui/index.tsx` (separate `./tui` export from `package.json`).
- Triggers: OpenCode TUI loads the entry declared in `tui.json`.
- Responsibilities: Register Magic Context command-palette entries (with dual-path fallback for `api.keymap.registerLayer` vs legacy `api.command.register`); register sidebar slot; mount RPC-backed data layer.

**Message transform entry:**
- Location: `src/plugin/messages-transform.ts`
- Triggers: `experimental.chat.messages.transform`
- Responsibilities: Defensive wrapper around the magic-context hook's transform — catches transient `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED` errors and other failures, persists summary to `session_meta.last_transform_error`, and falls back to unmodified messages so OpenCode's prompt loop always proceeds.

**System-prompt transform entry:**
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/system-prompt-hash.ts`
- Triggers: `experimental.chat.system.transform`
- Responsibilities: Inject `<project-docs>`, `<user-profile>`, `<key-files>` adjunct blocks and Magic Context guidance text; persist `system_prompt_hash` for cache-stability decisions; skip injection for OpenCode's internal `title`/`summary`/`compaction` agents and any agents matched by user-configured `system_prompt_injection.skip_signatures`.

**Event entry:**
- Location: `src/plugin/event.ts`
- Triggers: OpenCode session and message lifecycle events.
- Responsibilities: Forward lifecycle events to the runtime event handler — `message.updated` (usage tracking, model drift detection, message-index live updates, Channel-2 ceiling-nudge delivery on step boundaries), `message.removed` (tag/index cleanup, anchor cleanup), `session.deleted` (full-session cleanup). The historian trigger decision no longer runs here — it lives in the transform, fed by the in-memory message tail (the event handler has no message array and the old per-streaming-delta DB read froze the event loop on large sessions).

**Tool entry:**
- Location: `src/plugin/tool-registry.ts`
- Triggers: Plugin initialization.
- Responsibilities: Open storage, normalize arg schemas, and expose the supported tool set.

**Tool definition entry:**
- Location: `src/index.ts` (`tool.definition` hook calls `recordToolDefinition`)
- Triggers: OpenCode `tool.definition` hook (per tool per flight).
- Responsibilities: Record tool description and parameter token counts per `(provider, model, agent, tool_id)` for sidebar token attribution, with content-fingerprint short-circuit to avoid re-measuring stable definitions.

**RPC server entry:**
- Location: `src/shared/rpc-server.ts` (started from `src/index.ts`)
- Triggers: Plugin initialization.
- Responsibilities: Bind localhost RPC server on ephemeral port; publish port via `session_meta` for TUI discovery; serve sidebar/status/recomp/notification endpoints registered by `src/plugin/rpc-handlers.ts`.

Subagents run heuristic drops on every execute pass (no once-per-turn guard) because a long subagent run is effectively one parent turn and would otherwise starve; they have no provider-cache reuse to protect.

## Error handling

Fail **closed** when storage is unavailable (better to disable than silently overflow the prompt). Fail **open** in per-turn handlers (log and skip). Wrap the outer transform so transient `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED` never crash the prompt loop (#23). `overflow-detection.ts` parses provider context-overflow errors (Anthropic / OpenAI / Copilot) and persists the detected limit so later passes use the lower value. Subagent model fallback (`model-suggestion-retry.ts`) iterates the chain on retryable failures; abort/timeout/context-overflow short-circuit. Hidden agents carry a `steps`/`maxSteps` cap and are aborted via `session.abort` on timeout so a weak local model can't loop forever (#154).

**Subagent rationale:** subagents are driven by a parent agent, have bounded lifetimes, and often run in parallel (council, historian, sidekick, dreamer child sessions). They still benefit from automatic heuristic drops on their own context at execute passes (running on EVERY execute pass, not once-per-turn — long-running subagents are effectively one parent turn, and they'd starve under the parent's once-per-turn gate), but turning on historian, nudges, or prompt-adjunct injections in each subagent would create redundant work and per-agent cache churn. Subagents that run into overflow fall back to the existing `overflow-detection.ts` path; the detected limit is recorded so future passes use the lower value, but no emergency-recovery flag is persisted because subagents don't consume that path. The skill-memory `<skill-memory>` recall append is the one exception that IS active for subagents: it rides the same ungated `tool.execute.after` path as the Channel-1 nudge (it is a tool-result append, NOT a prompt-adjunct injection), so an implementer subagent that loads a skill benefits from that skill's accumulated gotchas — the append lands in the subagent's own tool result (cache-safe in its context) at the cost of a single DB read.

## Tag identity

Each `tags` row is one taggable source-content unit (`message`, `file`, or `tool`). `message`/`file` tags key on `(session_id, message_id)` (synthetic content id). **`tool` tags key on a COMPOSITE `(session_id, callID, tool_owner_message_id)`** — because OpenCode reuses a `callID` counter per assistant turn, so the same `read:32` recurs across turns; including the owning assistant message id gives each invocation its own row (migration v10). Owner derivation: invocation parts own themselves; result parts pop a FIFO of unpaired invocations; a result whose invocation was compacted away falls back to the nearest prior persisted owner. The same composite keying mirrors in the drop queue and heuristic cleanup so dropped keys match what the tagger persisted. Per-tag token counts (`token_count` / `input_token_count` / `reasoning_token_count`) are computed once on tag insert and summed for sidebar / boundary / nudge math (off the hot path).

**Provider error parsing:** `src/features/magic-context/overflow-detection.ts` parses provider-specific context-overflow errors (Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot) and persists the detected limit to `session_meta.detected_context_limit` so subsequent passes use the lower value. `needs_emergency_recovery` is set for primary sessions; subagents skip emergency-recovery state because they don't consume that path.

**Subagent model fallback:** `promptSyncWithModelSuggestionRetry` in `src/shared/model-suggestion-retry.ts` iterates the resolved fallback chain (user-configured `fallback_models` or builtin chain) on retryable failures. Abort, timeout, and context-overflow errors short-circuit the chain — those won't succeed on a different model and the caller's emergency-recovery path handles them. Suggestion retry ("did you mean X?") runs inside each attempt.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Logging:** Use buffered file logging from `src/shared/logger.ts` and write to the temp-file path returned by `getLogFilePath()`. Per-session logs use `sessionLog(sessionId, message)`; module-level logs use `log(message)`. Heavy logging batches to disk to avoid blocking the transform path.

**Caching:** Use deferred reductions, cached memory-block injection, per-session TTL tracking, per-tag cached token counts (computed once on tag insert), persisted reminder-replay state, per-session live injection cache, persisted system-prompt hash, and persisted todo-snapshot replay state — all coordinated through `src/hooks/magic-context/` and `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-*.ts`.

**Storage:** Use the SQLite database created by `src/features/magic-context/storage-db.ts` under the cortexkit data directory resolved by `src/shared/data-path.ts` (`~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/context.db` on Linux/macOS, XDG-equivalent on Windows). Legacy OpenCode-plugin-folder DBs are migrated forward on first boot. The same DB is shared cross-harness between OpenCode and Pi; session-scoped tables include a `harness` discriminator (`'opencode'` / `'pi'`) while project-scoped tables (memories, git commits) are shared.

**Schema migrations:** `src/features/magic-context/migrations.ts` declares versioned migrations v1–v39 (`LATEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION = 39` in `storage-db.ts` is the schema-fence ceiling and MUST be bumped with every new migration; a unit test — `schema-version-fence.test.ts` — asserts `LATEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION === LATEST_MIGRATION_VERSION` so the two can't drift). Notable: v10 `tool_owner_message_id` (composite tool-tag identity); v11 `todo_synthetic_*` (synthetic-todowrite); v12 orphan `memory_embeddings` cleanup; v13 `pending_compaction_marker_state` (deferred-marker drain); v14 project-scoped key files + version counter; v15 `deferred_execute_state` (boundary execution); v16 context-limit cache sentinels; v17 multi-anchor note-nudge/auto-search JSON storage; v18 `pending_pi_compaction_marker_state`; v19 compartment-state lease table; v20 subagent invocation token accounting; v21 session lifetime work metrics; **v22 the v2.0 cache-architecture foundation (m[0]/m[1] split tables, `project_state` epoch counter, plus per-compartment `p1`–`p4` tier columns, `importance`, `episode_type`, `p1_embedding`, and `legacy` flag); v23 `compartment_events` (historian-extracted causal_incident / trajectory_correction, stored-not-rendered in v2.0); v24 `historian_runs` telemetry (per-run chunk range, compartment/fact/event counts, importance min/max/avg, status + failure reason, FK to `subagent_invocations`); v25 `pi_stable_id_scheme` (Pi stable-id cutover watermark); v26 `memory_mutation_log` + `cached_m1_bytes` (memory supersede-delta — non-additive in-session memory mutations render as an m[1] `<memory-updates>` delta instead of bumping the project epoch, plus the frozen-m[1]-bytes cache column); v27 `tags.entry_fingerprint` (Pi fallback-tag adoption); v28 `git_sweep_coordinator` (lease/cooldown for cross-process git-commit sweeps); v29 `notes.anchor_ordinal` (note→conversation-tail traceback); v30 `cached_m0_system_hash` / `cached_m0_tool_set_hash` / `cached_m0_model_key` (HARD-bust m[0] markers — provider-side cache-eviction detection for the materialization taxonomy; the migration clears the m[0]/m[1] cache once so pre-v30 rows re-materialize cleanly); v31 ctx_reduce-nudge state (`last_nudge_undropped`, `channel2_nudge_state`, `last_emergency_input_sample` + startup heal zeroing legacy sticky/anchor nudge state); v32 protected-tail v3 boundary state + per-tag cached token counts (`tags.token_count` / `input_token_count` / `reasoning_token_count` — computed once on tag insert, summed for sidebar/boundary/nudge math); v33 `compartment_chunk_embeddings` table for cross-session semantic search across compartment windows; v34 `workspaces` / `workspace_members` tables plus `cached_m0_workspace_fingerprint` m[0] marker (with a one-shot m[0]/m[1] cache reset so pre-v34 rows re-materialize cleanly); v35 `workspaces.share_categories` default + epoch refresh for existing members; v36 `session_projects` ownership map + seed for pre-v36 embedded sessions; v37 emergency drain catch-up latch + historian drain failure backoff; v38 `transform_decisions` table for durable cache-event cause attribution; **v39 `skill_memory` table for per-skill cross-session recall (the `skill-memory` feature — see "Skill-memory" in Key Abstractions) with `(skill_id, tier, project_identity, normalized_hash)` UNIQUE, plus `idx_skill_memory_lookup` and `idx_skill_memory_fts_prep` indexes for the flat-recall path.** Migration runner uses `schema_migrations` table with version-ordered execution and sibling-startup race protection (duplicate-insert is tolerated).

**Harness-aware behavior:** `src/shared/harness.ts` exposes `setHarness()`/`getHarness()` for the runtime to identify itself; production INSERTs into session-scoped tables tag rows with the current harness. Pi-specific session-resolution paths are skipped on OpenCode and vice versa.

## Tag Identity (v3.3.1+)

**Tag types:** `message`, `file`, `tool`. Each row in the `tags` table represents one source-content unit that can be tagged with `§N§` and dropped/truncated/replayed by the runtime.

**Identity composition by type:**

- **`message` and `file` tags:** identified by `(session_id, message_id)`. The `message_id` for these is a synthetic content id (`<msgId>:p<partIndex>` for text, `<msgId>:fileN` for files). These ids are globally unique within a session.

- **`tool` tags:** identified by `(session_id, message_id, tool_owner_message_id)` — a *composite* identity. For tool tags, `message_id` is the OpenCode-generated callID (e.g. `read:32`). Pre-v3.3.1 the runtime keyed tool tags by callID alone, but OpenCode reuses a callID counter per assistant turn — so two assistant turns that each invoke `read:32` produced the SAME callID for different invocations. The fix: include the *owning assistant message id* in the key so each invocation gets its own row.

**Schema enforcement:** schema migration v10 (`src/features/magic-context/migrations.ts`) adds `tool_owner_message_id` (`TEXT NULL`), a partial UNIQUE index `idx_tags_tool_composite` on `(session_id, message_id, tool_owner_message_id) WHERE type='tool' AND tool_owner_message_id IS NOT NULL`, and a partial lookup index `idx_tags_tool_null_owner` on `(session_id, message_id) WHERE type='tool' AND tool_owner_message_id IS NULL` to back lazy adoption.

**Helper API surface (`src/features/magic-context/storage-tags.ts`):**

- `getToolTagNumberByOwner(db, sessionId, callId, ownerMsgId)`: composite-identity lookup.
- `getNullOwnerToolTag(db, sessionId, callId)`: find a legacy NULL-owner orphan to lazily adopt.
- `adoptNullOwnerToolTag(db, tagId, ownerMsgId)`: attempt to claim a NULL-owner row (NULL guard ensures first claim wins).
- `getPersistedToolOwnerNearestPrior(db, sessionId, callId, beforeMessageId)`: derive the most recent prior owner for a tool result whose invocation isn't in the visible window.
- `deleteToolTagsByOwner(db, sessionId, ownerMsgId)`: cascade delete on `message.removed`.

**Owner derivation (`src/hooks/magic-context/tag-messages.ts`):**

For each tool observation in a transform pass:

1. **Invocation parts** (`tool-invocation` / `tool_use`): owner = the message hosting the part.
2. **Result parts** (`tool` with output / `tool_result`): pop the FIFO queue of unpaired invocations for that callId; owner = the popped invocation's message id.
3. **Result-only window** (invocation compacted away): fall back to `getPersistedToolOwnerNearestPrior` for the most recent prior persisted owner; if none found, last-resort owner = the result's own message id.

The same logic mirrors in `src/hooks/magic-context/read-session-chunk.ts: getRawSessionTagKeysThrough` so the drop queue produces composite keys that match what the tagger persisted.

**Cleanup paths:**

- `deleteTagsByMessageId(db, sessionId, messageId)` (called from `event-handler.ts` on `message.removed`) deletes BOTH content-id-scoped tags (text/file on the removed message) AND owner-scoped tool tags (`tool_owner_message_id == messageId`).
- `applyHeuristicCleanup` keys both the tag-side index and fingerprint-side map by composite `<ownerMsgId>\x00<callId>`. The fingerprint VALUE includes ownerMsgId too, so cross-owner pairs with same `(toolName, args)` produce DISTINCT fingerprints and are NOT merged.

**Legacy NULL-owner handling:** rows written by pre-v3.3.1 plugin versions have `tool_owner_message_id = NULL`. The Layer B backfill (`src/features/magic-context/tool-owner-backfill.ts`) populates those rows from OpenCode's session DB on plugin upgrade (lease-based concurrency, batched commits). When backfill is skipped (no OpenCode DB attached) lazy adoption converts orphans to non-NULL on the next observation. Drop queue and heuristic cleanup gracefully fall back to bare-callId match for unbackfilled NULL-owner rows.
